Title: Fundamentals of Machine Learning Engineering

Abstract:

Machine learning engineering is the practice of applying machine
learning science to production systems. It requires expertise in both
machine learning methods and software engineering. In practice, few
individuals have sufficiently deep experience in both fields to act as
sole practitioners. Scientists and engineers instead must work
together, leveraging the skill and experience of one another, to build
state-of-the-art machine learning enabled systems.

In this masterclass, Garrett Smith, founder of Chicago ML and creator
of Guild AI, teaches the fundamentals of machine learning
engineering. The class is tailored to both software engineers and data
scientists.

The masterclass teaches how to:

- Validate problem definition and approach given available data and
  methods
- Select preliminary models
- Recreate results on benchmark data sets
- Develop training and validation data sets
- Automate experiment tracking and measurement
- Adapt models and tune performance
- Deploy and support production models

Students participate through hands-on exercises that follow best
practices at each stage of development. They learn concepts as well as
tools and techniques they can apply to build production ML systems
with optimal performance.

If you're interested in the applied side of machine learning - how you
can most effectively support development of ML enabled systems - this
masterclass gives you a solid foundation in a single day of practical
teaching.

This masterclass requires proficiency with the Python programming
language and experience running programs in a command line
environment. Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals is helpful but
not required.

Speaker Bio:

Garrett Smith is an independent consultant specializing in machine
learning application and program development. He has over 25 years
experience in software and systems engineering. Garrett founded
Chicago ML, a 3500 member organization of machine learning
practitioners, researchers, and students. He is a frequent teacher,
speaker, and event organizer in support of best-practices in applied
machine learning and AI.

Garrett is the creator of Guild AI, an open source toolkit for
running, tracking and comparing machine learning experiments. Guild AI
is used by machine learning developers to rapidly improve their models
through automated training and testing.

Prior to his work in machine learning, Garrett ran operations for
CloudBees Java Platform as a Service. There he built the back-end
systems responsible for thousands of business critical applications
and databases in a high availability, high performance environment.

Garrett uses Python in his machine learning work but looks forward to
the day he can resume use of his favorite language, Erlang.
